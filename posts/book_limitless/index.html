Once you have access to the limitless capacity to learn, you are able to achieve better results in every field of life.</li></ul><h3 id=why-this-matters-know>Why this matters know?</h3><ul><li>The digital age comes with four problems caused by overreliance on the technologies<ul><li>digital deluge - if we never let our mind wander or be bored for a moment, we pay a price - poor memory, mental fog and fatigue</li><li>digital distraction - Asking the brain to shift attention from one activity to another causes the prefrontal cortex and striatum to burn up oxygenated glucose, the same fuel they need to stay on task</li><li>digital dementia - Too often, we outsource our brains to our smart devices, and our smart devices are making us, well, a little bit stupid. Our brains are the ultimate adaptation machines, capable of seemingly endless levels of evolution</li><li>digital deduction - We tend to identify a handful of sources with which we align and then give those sources extreme influence over our thinking and decision-making. In the process, the “muscles” we use to think critically and reason effectively are atrophying. We’re letting technology do the deuction for us.</li></ul></li><li>Conscious awareness is the first part of solving a problem</li></ul><h3 id=your-limitless-brain>Your limitless brain</h3><ul><li>Every brain is unique</li><li>Our brains have the capacity for neuroplasticity, which means that it can be changed and shaped by our actions and by our environments. Your brain is always changing and molding itself to your surroundings and to the demands you place on it</li><li>Neuroplasticity means that every time you learn something new, your brain makes a new synaptic connection. And each time this happens, your brain physically changes-it upgrades its hardware to reflect a new level of the mind</li><li>If learning is making new connections, then remembering is maintaining and sustaining those connections.</li><li>If we respond to the lapse in memory with the attitude that we are bad in memorization than we negatively affect our ability to learn and grow.</li><li>There are no limitations when you align and apply the right mindset, motivation, and methods.</li><li>We have a second brain - the gut. It impacts our digestion, mood, health and even the way you think.</li><li>The brain take up to 20% of the energy we take in, so nutrients make a huge difference in the way our brains function on day-to-day basis.</li><li>Your gut have its own way of interpreting events and giving your brain signals.</li><li>If the workplace is evolving with so much rapidity that we can never be sure of what work will mean to us tomorrow, then only by taking complete control of our learning can we truly be prepared for an unknowable future</li><li>Brain power trumps brute strength and one screw can make all the difference.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-and-remember-this-book>How to and remember this book?</h3><hr><ul><li>The time one can hold focus is about 10 - 40 minutes. So pomodoro is good method to hold focus.</li><li>You have primacy and recency phase. These are the phases where you retain the information - you read - the most. It’s in the beginning and in the end of an event. So if you hold the pomodoro phases small (25 min), then you will have much more primacy and recency phases than if you have only one phase without a break.</li><li>Use the FASTER method to learn anything more quickly<ul><li>F → Forget<ul><li>Get a beginners mind. Do not assume that you’re already know something about the new topic</li><li>Forget what’s not urgent or important</li><li>Forget about your limitations. Have a positive self-talk</li></ul></li><li>A → Act<ul><li>Not just read to forget. Try make notes or try to talk with somebody else about your learnings. Learning is not a passive experience</li></ul></li><li>S → State<ul><li>Put yourself in a better mood. The mood you put yourself in influences your learning. So make sure you have the right mindset (get excited about your new learnings) and the right physical condition of your body (posture). All learning is state-dependent</li></ul></li><li>T → Teach<ul><li>If you teach, you learn twice. The first time for yourself and the second time by educating another person</li></ul></li><li>E → Enter<ul><li>Make a calender entry for every body and brain activity and schedule this. So you make sure to not forget what is the most important for you</li></ul></li><li>R → Review<ul><li>Make use of spaced repitition to reduce the memory loss effect of the learning curve. For example, for each reading session review the last reading session</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Commit to your choice and really do what you have chosen</li><li>Questions are the answers. Your brain is a filter and concentrates only on a little amount of senses you receive. These senses you receive are determined by the questions you ask yourself. The brain shows you more of what you express interest in, and it hides the things you don’t engage in.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=part-2---mindset>Part 2 - Mindset</h2><h3 id=limitless-mindset>Limitless Mindset</h3><ul><li>All behavior is driven by belief - you can learn helplessness, but also limitless mindset</li><li>Our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we must be accountable for who we become</li><li>It is important to conquer your limiting beliefs, because these determine how you behave and think</li><li>Everyone is a genius. There are four kinds:<ul><li>Dynamo genius - express their genius through creativity and ideas</li><li>Blaze genius - becomes clear through interacting with others</li><li>Tempo genius - expresses itself through their ability to see the big picture and stay the course</li><li>Steel genius - brilliant at sweating the small stuff and doing something with the the details that others missed or couldn’t envision</li></ul></li><li>Positive thinking lead to better stress management. And this comes with increased life span, lower rates of depression, lower levels of confidence, greater resistance to the common cold, better psychological and physical well-being, better cardiovascular health and reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, better coping skills during hardships and times of stress</li><li>Limiting beliefs make you react to the environment, but a limitless mindset make the environment align to your goals</li><li>There are three keys for a superhero mindset<ul><li>Get the source of limiting beliefs - these aren’t facts, but rather opinions</li><li>Get to the facts - is there an evidence in reality that you are truly hampered in one area and wether even that evidence was tainted by the noise in your head</li><li>Create a new belief - supplant the old negative belief with a new one. For negative self-talk also create another different inner persona. Make it cartoonish and then its easier quieting it</li></ul></li><li>When you’re experiencing positive emotions like joy, contentment, and love, you will see more possibilities in your life</li><li>Positive emotion:<ul><li>… broaden people’s attention and thinking</li><li>… undo lingering negative emotional arousal</li><li>… fuel psychological resilience</li><li>… build consequential personal resources</li><li>… trigger upward spirals towards greater well-being in the future</li><li>… seed human flourishing</li></ul></li><li>Positive emotions transform people for the better and set them on paths toward flourishing and healthy longevity</li></ul><h3 id=the-7-lies-of-learning>The 7 lies of learning</h3><ol><li>Intelligence is fixed<ol><li>Fixed mindset vs. growth mindset - If we think our mindset is fixed, then our goal is to pretend that we are smart, but if we know that we are able to develop talents and abilities through effort, good teaching and persistence, we can get smarter if we work at it</li><li>IQ test scores are relatively stable - not to our intelligence levels, which are constantly increasing</li><li>Intelligence is fluid - your intelligence is not only malleable but dependent on your ability to cultivate a growth mindset</li></ol></li><li>We only use 10 percent of our brains<ol><li>There are many scientific discoveries that refuse this myth - one is the synaptic pruning. If we didn’t use a large portion of our brains, we would expect to see large areas of degeneration</li><li>I am learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible</li></ol></li><li>Mistakes are failures<ol><li>Instead of looking at mistakes as proof of failure, take them as proof that you are trying</li><li>There is no such thing as failure. Only failure to learn.</li></ol></li><li>Knowledge is power<ol><li>Knowledge is important, but it is the ‘performing of some action’ that is required to make it powerful</li><li>Don’t promise, prove. Your results will speak for themselves</li><li>Knowledge * Action = Power</li></ol></li><li>Learning new things is very difficult<ol><li>Learning won’t always be easy, but the effort pays dividends</li><li>One important key to learn efficient is consistency</li><li>When you learn new ways how to learn, the challenge of learning new things can be fun, easier, and more enjoyable</li></ol></li><li>The criticism of other people matters<ol><li>People have a hard time reconciling what they believe is possible with what is actually happening</li><li>Creating the life you want can be scary. But you know what’s scarier? Regret</li><li>It’s not your job to like, love, or respect me.

You give because it’s who you are</li></ul></li><li>Gratitude<ul><li>How can you appreciate the things you’ll eventually have if you don’t appreciate what you have now?</li><li>If you want to truly feel wealthy, write down everything you have in your life that money can’t buy. Think of your health, the people you love, your sense of sight, etc.</li><li>Success builds on success – but you must appreciate the success you already have.</li></ul></li><li>Grit<ul><li>Grit is perseverance, persistence, and your ability to overcome difficulties</li><li>When you have a big goal, you’re going to face challenges.</li><li>Look at your problems as puzzles.</li><li>To build grit, put yourself in uncomfortable positions.</li><li>Bruce Lee once said, “If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there. You must go beyond them.”</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2 id=part-3---motivation>Part 3 - Motivation</h2><ul><li>Motivation is not something you have; it’s something you do. And it’s entirely sustainable. Motivation is a process and you can have control over it.</li><li>The formula for motivation: Motivation = Purpose x Energy x Small Simple Steps</li></ul><h3 id=purpose>Purpose</h3><ul><li>During sleep charge your energy for the next day. So if you sleep less, you don’t have that much energy</li><li>If you prioritize and get clear about your commitments, you don’t need that much energy.</li><li>It’s not important what you do, it’s important why you do something</li><li>Set your goals SMART<ul><li>specific</li><li>measurable</li><li>actionable</li><li>realistic</li><li>time-based</li></ul></li><li>Your goals should fit with your HEART<ul><li>healthy</li><li>enduring</li><li>alluring</li><li>relevant</li><li>truth</li></ul></li><li>Passion is what lights you up inside - but it takes experimentation and effort to see what clicks for you. It also can change over time</li><li>Purpose is what you’re here to share with the world. It’s how you use your passion</li><li>“The highest drive we have is to act consistently with how we perceive ourselves. Consciously identify or unidentify with a habit you want / no longer want”</li><li>Your values need to be in alignment with your goals!</li><li>Be clear about your decisions. It should only be a hell yes or a no! - JOMO (Joy of missing out)</li><li>Motivation comes with emotions. Feel the benefits you will get from an action, or the pain you will get if you don’t perform the action</li><li>Motivation is a set of habits and routines, guided by your values and your identity, that you carry out every day</li></ul><h3 id=energy>Energy</h3><ol><li>A Good Brain Diet<ol><li>Avocados - healthy blood flow</li><li>Blueberries - reduce the effects of brain aging and can help with memory</li><li>Broccoli - vitamin K, which is known to improve cognitive function and memory</li><li>Dark chocolate - focus and concentration, also improve cognitive function</li><li>Eggs - memory-improving and brain-boosting choline</li><li>Green leafy vegetables - vitamin E, reduces the effects of brain aging</li><li>Salmon - omega-3, reduce the effects of brain aging</li><li>Turmeric - reduce inflammation and boost antioxidant levels</li><li>Walnuts - vitamin E, protect neurons and protect against brain aging</li><li>Water - hydration good against brain fog, fatigue, and slower reaction</li></ol></li><li>Brain Nutrients<ol><li>Do not hesitate to supplement</li></ol></li><li>Exercise<ol><li>Theres a direct correlation between exercise and brain function</li></ol></li><li>Killing ANTs (Automatic negative thoughts)<ol><li>Be aware of the negative self-talk and replace it by a positive self-talk</li></ol></li><li>A clean environment<ol><li>Have good air conditions</li><li>clean and minimal environment</li></ol></li><li>A positive peer group<ol><li>Your social environment influences your decisions. “You are the average of the 5 people you are interacting the most”</li><li>Make sure your goals are in alignment with these of your friends</li></ol></li><li>Brain Protection</li><li>New Learnings</li><li>Stress management<ol><li>Stress makes your primitive are of your brain work more.

You can train it. To do so, make sure to only focus on thing at the same in every situation. And remove physical items from your workspace, because they compete about your attention.</li><li>Distractions can cause overthinking which lead to anxiety. This again, implies overthinking and you’re prisoned in a negative loop. So avoiding distractions help for concentration, but also for mental health.</li><li>There are three tools how you can calm your busy mind:<ol><li>Breathing - use the 4-7-8 technique to re-center your mind</li><li>Do the task that causes stress - simply do the thing that causes stress if possbile</li><li>Block time for the things that causes stress to handle later</li></ol></li></ul><h3 id=study>Study</h3><ul><li>Cramming with respect to the effects primacy and recency on memory is a bad learning method</li><li>Seven habits to unlimit your studies:<ul><li>Active recall - the best would be to review the lecture you heard 4 time by writing down everything you have remembered from the lecture and checking what is missing.</li><li>Spaced repetition - learn things within specific intervals. This strengthening a connection in your brain.</li><li>Manage the state you are in - if you’re are feeling great, the results will be better. And your posture controls the state of your mind.</li><li>Use your sense of smell - the sense of smelling is connected with parts of the brain accountable for memory and emotions. Thus, it can help studying more efficient. Rosemary to improve memory and peppermint and lemon to promote concentration.</li><li>Music for the mind - music has a connection to the mood. And the mood in turn has a connection to learning. Especially baroque music puts you into deep concentration.</li><li>Listen with your whole brain - your brain can digest 400 words per minute. More then someone can talk. So you can be distraced very easily by other things. Avoid distractions and put attention on body language and vocals. Imagine to be the speaker and try to involve emtions by anticipating. If you can, review the speech. Take notes and ask question, even if they are repetitive. For that remember HEAR:<ul><li>Halt</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Anticipation</li><li>Review</li></ul></li><li>Take notes of taking notes - make sure to be clear about the goal you want to achieve with the notes. Take notes that are relevant for this goal and review these notes right after the lecture by adding additional information and highlighting the most important thing. Prioritize the information. Remember TIP:<ul><li>Think - what are you hoping to retain with the session</li><li>Identify - identify what matters the most in context of your goal</li><li>Prioritize - process the information you took and create a hierarchy by highlighting</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=memory>Memory</h3><ul><li>A good memory can be learned. And you will remember more and learn faster due training your memory - the more you remember, the more you can learn.</li><li>To develope your memory remember MOM<ul><li>Motivation - motivation helps to memorize</li><li>Observation - Be present in the moments you will retain and memorize something</li><li>Methods - have the memory toolkit by your side</li></ul></li><li>Associations boost our memory. Try to remember a list of words associated with a story. This will help a lot</li><li>Rote learning is among other things so useless because it only involves a small area of your brain</li><li>The keys for efficient memory are<ul><li>Visualization - you see pictures in your mind; not words</li><li>Association - new knowledge is associated by already known patterns</li><li>Emotion - makes things more action-filled, better imaginable</li><li>Location - we were haunters-gatherers, so we needed to remember which location provides water, food etc.</li></ul></li><li>Methods<ul><li>Story for a list of words</li><li>Walk a path with 10 locations. Each location for a keynote message you want to talk about when you need to memorize in bulk</li><li>For remembering vocabulary use the word substitution method, where you substitute a word in more that are easy to memorize and visualize<ul><li>Monroe can be a man rowing</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=speed-reading>Speed Reading</h3><ul><li>Reading improves imagination, vocabulary, understanding, memory, focus, ‘brain strength’</li><li>There are three obstacles preventing you to read more efficient<ul><li>You don’t learn the skill to read anymore</li><li>Subvocalization - in your mind you read out the words loud. You don’t need that.</li><li>Regression - dont reread words. That distracts you</li></ul></li><li>Myth 1 - Faster readers don’t comprehend well<ul><li>If you read faster, you focus more on what you read. So you comprehend even better what you are reading</li></ul></li><li>Myth 2 - It’s harder and takes more effort to read fast<ul><li>Slow readers reread, stop at words and think more about some words. This takes much more effort then going over each word faster.</li></ul></li><li>Myth 3 - Faster Readers can’t appreciate reading<ul><li>Faster readers can speed up reading on boring parts. So they are flexible.</li></ul></li><li>Use your finger to read faster. Your visual and touch senses are closely linked and it prevents regression.</li><li>Try to identify word groups that you can interpret together (e.g. report card).</li><li>Count out loud while reading to suppress the inner voice.</li></ul><h3 id=thinking>Thinking</h3><ul><li>You need to overthink your perspectives you’re thinking of from time to time</li><li>Solving a problem with all perspectives can be life changing. For that use the six thinking hats technique<ul><li>White hat - get all the information about the topic</li><li>Yellow hat - think about all positives</li><li>Black hat - think about all negatives</li><li>Red hat - think about emotions</li><li>Green hat - think about creative and own ideas to that topic</li><li>Blue hat - Set your goals to achieve what you were thinking about</li></ul></li><li>There are eight forms of intelligence<ul><li>Spatial - think from the perspective of space around them</li><li>Bodily-Kinesthetic - uses their body to think</li><li>Musical - strong sensitivity to rhythm, meter, tone, melody</li><li>Linguistic - attuned to all implications of words</li><li>Logical-Mathematical - logical relations among actions or symbols</li><li>Interpersonal - innate ability to understand others and connect to them</li><li>Intrapersonal - ability to understand yourself</li><li>Naturalistic - ability to see the complex world</li></ul></li><li>Decision-Making<ul><li>40/70 rule - get al least 40 percent of information, but not more than 70 percent</li><li>It’s just a way to make a decision faster and from another perspective</li></ul></li><li>Productivity<ul><li>Not-to-do-list</li><li>Write down everything you will not focus on this day. This will help you remain your focus on the important tasks that actually will bring you forward.</li></ul></li><li>Problem-solving<ul><li>Study your errors</li><li>Search for the origin of error. Layer for layer ask questions why you’ve failed. Once you found out, resolve this problem.</li></ul></li><li>Strategy<ul><li>Second-Order Thinking</li><li>Think about deeper consequencen. Ask question like ‘And then?’ over and over again for different increments of time</li></ul></li><li>Exponential thinking<ul><li>Linear thinking is the most common. Try to solve problem when they occur in your project straight up and try to predict upcoming problem. But what is when you try to seek for the root of the problem and solve this instead. Then you think exponentially.</li><li>Four steps<ul><li>Get to the underlying problem - search for the root of the problem</li><li>Posit a new approach - Try to consider alternitives with what-if statements</li><li>Read about it - Read about the alternatives</li><li>Extrapolate - Prioritize the alternatives and turn one into action, even if this seems to be too much effort at once (e.g. moving to another city)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/portfolio-website/tags/productivity/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Productivity</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/portfolio-website/tags/neuroscience/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Neuroscience</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/portfolio-website/tags/personal-development/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">Personal Development</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://arne-wiese.github.io/portfolio-website/>&copy;
