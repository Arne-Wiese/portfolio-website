## Introduction

- Visualization is the key to communicate data.
- This book is about to get the best out of your visualizations for your specific context. Remove clutter, which kinds of graphs you can use, design, storytelling, dissecting your data etc.

## The importance of context

- Knowing the context of your presentation leads to a much better presentation
- Explanatory -and Exploratory analysis
    - Exploratory - find the most important findings (e.g. 2 out of 100)
    - Explanatory - present your findings
- To find the most important information there are three keys
    - Who is your audience. How is your relationship to your audience?
    - What you want your audience to know about - involve your audience and communicate in different ways for different kinds of presentations
    - How can you use data to underline your point
        - 3-minute story - what you want to communicate in three minutes. Make it clear.
        - Big Idea - what you want to communicate in one sentence
- Storyboard for the structure
    - start with a simple storyboard to structure your communication. The end is the big idea. The beginning the issue.
    - make it on paper. If you make it on computer you are attached to the things you’ve already done, because you put a lot of effort in it.

## Choosing an effective visual

- Simple Text
    - If just have two numbers to communicate, use the numbers directly
- Table
    - Tables are good when your audience if from mixed domain. They can pick the columns they are interested in. But caution: A table takes attention.
    - Interact with verbal system
- Heatmap
    - When you want to highlight some numbers in a table use a heatmap. This will require less attention for audience then showing just a simple table
- Graphs
    - Scatterplot
        - Useful for showing relationships between two featrues
    - Line graph
        - Useful to show numeric data over time
    - Slope graph
        - Useful to show categorical change over time
- Bars
    - Bars should have a zero baseline. Otherwise it seems like manipulation and your argument gets lost as well as your credibility
    - Vertical Bar Chart
        - Compare categories
    - Stacked Vertical Bar Chart
        - Compare totals with amounts of categories
    - Waterfall Chart
        - Focuses on one stacked vertical series to see changes for one category
    - Horizontal Bar Chart
        - First focus on all categories and then data. The go-to for categorical data.
    - Area Chart
        - avoid most area graphs
        - visualize number of a vastly different magnitude
- Graphs to be avoided
    - Pie Charts (hard to compare values against each other)
    - Donut Chart
    - 3d Graphs - skew your perception
    - Graphs with secondary y-axis
        - make two graphs out of it
        - label the data

## Clutter is your enemy!

- Your audience has a limit on cognitive load. The visual needs to be processed. The more information, the harder to process the visual.
- Clutter contributes to excessive cognitive load. Clutter are visuals that take space, but unnecessary when it comes to information
- There are 6 principles to create or perceive order in visual stimuli
    - Connectivity - connected things are grouped
    - Continuity - we create continuity in what we see
    - Enclosure - enclosed elements belong to group
    - Closure - see simple objects first, then individual elements
    - Similarity - color, shape
    - Proximity - dense elements are seen as group
- Lack of visual order make graphs hard to read
- Align your text that you have clean lines. Don’t use diagonal labels and place important information in the left-upper corner. (Because thats the starting point or reading)
- Whitespaces can be strategically used to emphasize information and are comfortable for the audience
- Use contrast effectively, meaning don’t let the information vanish by making all information a contrast to each other

## Focus your audiences attention

- The brain processes all visual information. There are three types of memory
    - iconic memory - here motion in your field of sight gets recognized, before the information moves to the short term memory. It’s also tuned to preattentive attributes like color, shape etc.
    - short term memory - ‘working memory’, where you only can store four chunks of visual information
    - long term memory - visual and verbal memory are accessed differently. Visuals helps us to get information stored in verbal memory much faster
- Preattentive attributes have two tasks
    1. Get the attention of the audience (5-8 seconds the audience decide wether to continue reading or focus on other things)
    2. Direct the attention in hierarchycal way from attribute to attribute
- There are three preattentive attributes that are the most important
    - size - make equal important information of similar size
    - color
        - use color sparingly - too much variety prevents anything from standing out
        - use color consistently - use same color for same purpose and structures. This prevents mental fatigue
        - use right tone of color - color evokes emotion. These emotion should fit to your information
    - position - the audience should have a natural feeling reading your slides. Don’t force them to read from bottom to top, or have negative numbers on the right

## Form follows function

- Form follows function.
- Affordance
    - You should know the function of the gear by design. The design should afford the use
    - Highlight important things - use preattentive attributes for that and stack these attribute for very important things
    - Remove distractions - eliminate clutter
    - Use hierarchy to indicate in which order the visual should be read - again use preattentive attributes with different strength and super-categories
- Accessibility
    - Don’t overcomplicate - Use straightforward language
    - Text is your friend - not everyone interprets the visuals the same way. So use text to let the audience know what the conclusion is
- Aesthetics
    - If something looks more aesthetic, you will spent more time looking at the visual. Use Color, Alignment and whitespaces for that
- Acceptance
    - people tend to decline your new visuals, because they are stucked to the way it has always been - try to get acceptance
        - side-by-side comparison of the visuals
        - show multiple options
        - show benefits
        - ask a vocal member of your audience to gain acceptance by everyone

## Dissecting model visuals

- Visual styles are always individual. But they always should be done with intention
- In this chapter some example visuals are examined and explained

## Lessons in storytelling

- Good stories grasp our attention
- Make use of the three-structured concept with begin (introduction), middle (challenge, conflict, tension) and end (solution)
- How to write with style
    - keep it simple
    - edit ruthlessly
    - be authentic
    - don’t communicate for yourself - communicate for your audience
    - the story is not for you; the story is for them
- First act
    - introduce the problem
- Second act
    - how can the problem be solved. how can the audience solve the problem?
    - use headlines to structure your presentation
- Third act
    - call your audience to action. Repeat the problem and make clear how the audience can react
- It’s important to have a good narrative. Without, the best data visualizations will not work out
- The narrative flow is important, too. You need to convince the audience with the process, make it chronologically. Is the audience already convinced and is interested in the ‘so what?’ lead with the ending
- Communicate to your audience how you will structure your presentation. That will calm the audience. If you don’t want to get interrupted, clarify that in the beginning
- Repetition helps us remembering important things. So for presentation include the same thing in headline, content and conclusion
- To make the story you want to tell become clear, you can use the following techniques
    - horizontal logic - have summary page and for each bullet point create that specific page again
    - vertical logic - on one page, connect headline to content and vice versa
    - reverse storyboarding - get your individual storyboard pages and create one page of the most important information of each
    - fresh perspective

## Case Studies

- Avoid colored background. If you need to align with brand colors, try to avoid that colors take attention
- For live presentation, show only the relevant parts of the graph using animation, so the audience retain attention on the important parts. For the circulation deck only use one annotated slide.
- There should be a logic in the order of the data. If you want to tell a single story leverage the order of your data. But if you want to tell more stories use the same structure of data (negative values → positive values), so that the audience don’t need to read all labels over and over again. Use same order, but leverage text, color etc.
- Avoid the spaghetti graph. Use single lines instead. Or split horizontally for each category. You can even combine these two techniques.
- Avoid pie charts. Use only text if just one number is relevant. Use simple bar graph if the comparison of each bar graph is important. Use Slopegraph for the development over time and use horizontally stacked bar graph to see the value of the category in its whole context.

## Final Thoughts

- Iterate over your visuals. Make a copy of it, do a change on that and take the better one for the next iteration
- Take time for the visualization step. It’s the only part of your entire process that the audience actually sees.
- Learn from good data visualizations. Look at them and think about what makes this visual so effective.
